# Night Lights Color Theme

Inspired by the [City Lights](https://citylights.xyz/) Color Theme for VS Code; enhanced for greater usability.

I have been a long time user and lover of City Lights, but it appears to be unmaintained and there were some subtle changes I wanted to make for enhanced readability, and some that just tickle my fancy. Many colors are the same, but I've increased the contrast for various elements and improved support for highlighting diffs.

This theme is largely for me, but if you like it and want to suggest additional improvements, feel free!

## Recommended VS Code settings
- `"editor.semanticHighlighting.enabled": false`
